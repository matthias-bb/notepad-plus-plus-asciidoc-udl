# notepad-plus-plus-asciidoc-udl

This repository contains a UDL configuration to add syntax highlighting for AsciiDoc in Notepad++.
The file is available for either light mode or dark mode.

Just download the XML file and import it into Notepad++ via menu Language -> User Defined Language -> Define your language... -> Import...

Notice that the UDL still has some flaws as the UDL feature in Notepad++ is primary aimed to support programming languages and not markup.
If you find it useful anyway, feel free to enhance the UDL, leave me a comment or make suggestions for improvements.
